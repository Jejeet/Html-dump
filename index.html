      <h2>Amala</h2>
      <p>
        Àmàlà is a local indigenous Yoruba food, native to the Yoruba ethnic
        group of Southwestern Nigeria.It is made out of yam and/or cassava
        flour, or unripe plantain flour.Tubers of yams are peeled, sliced,
        cleaned, dried and then blended into flour. It is also called èlùbọ́.
        Yams are white in colour but turn brown when dried which gives àmàlà its
        colour.It is a popular side dish served with ewédú and gbẹ̀gìrì
        (black-eyed beans soup), but is also served with a variety of other ọbẹ
        (soups), such as ẹ̀fọ́, ilá, and or ogbono
